				<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
				<h3>The Phelans of Goresgrove</h3>
				<p>The Phelans were farming at Goresgrove before 1800 and have done so continuously to this day. They were possibly at that spot a long time earlier but this account is based solely on evidence discovered to date. It will no doubt be expanded in the future.</p>
				<br />
				<p>There were two Phelan families, living in adjacent properties, and until recent individual research by members of each family was combined, the hereditary connections were lost in the mists of time. James Phelan (1793-1871) was married to Ellen Dullard (1798-1868) and had seven children, whilst next door his brother Michael Phelan was married to Martha Colclough in 1819. Sons of both families continued to work the land whilst other siblings emigrated, married and moved away from the immediate area, or left to join religious orders.</p> 
				<br />
				<p>The Popery Act of 1704 required land held (typically in tenancy) by Roman Catholics to be divided equally between all a landholder’s sons, (both legitimate and illegitimate), on his death. Known as sub-division, this inheritance practice, designed to keep the Catholic Irish from owning larger areas of land, continued until the middle of the 19th century. Close examination of maps, land surveys and tithe applotments, reveal that the farm at Goresgrove was divided equally around 1800 in terms of area and economic value. There is a straight line between the two farms which extends up the hill behind the houses, and is even evident in the vertical join in the wall at the front of the farms.</p>
				<br />
				<p>James was succeeded by his eldest son Michael (1822-1903) who married Johanna Hennessy (Laugh? Threecastles??). Of their six children it was their second son William (1870-1952) who took over the farm. William had 15 children of whom 12 survived and it was Pake (1922-1966) who married Maureen Breen and remained at Goresgrove. Of his 11 children it is Billy and his wife Geraldine who farm there today.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Meanwhile next door, Michael Phelan was succeeded by his sons William Michael (1819-1892) and Kyran (1821-1899). In 1850 William Michael left for a new future in America leaving Kyran to run the farm. He in turn handed over to his second son William (1861-1935), also known as Big Bill, who married Catherine Cummins. Two of Bill’s sons William (1912-1980) and Michael (1915-2002) continued this tradition but as neither married, the farm was passed on to their younger sister Mai (1920-2002) on the death of Michael. Mai married James Fitzgerald (1905-1978) and it is their son  Michael and his wife Noelle and family --who are living at Goresgrove today.</p>
				<br />
				<p>More recent research has revealed a third Phelan family living in close proximity, that of John Phelan of Kildrina (died 1868), was also related to the Phelans of Goresgrove. He was married to Mary Tobin (1778-1860) and had sons John, James and Richard who were all heavily involved with the Land League in the 1880s.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The aim of this book, is to document the research done thusfar, thereby spreading this knowledge gained to a wider diaspora than the immediate family and to gather together historical documents and images which, hopefully will be a source of interest to many. Thanks go to all involved in this research....... and especially to the late Margaret Hayes who took an interest in the family story whilst researching her excellent and informative book on the history of the parish of Urlingford and Graine, Halfway Between Dublin And Cork.</p>
